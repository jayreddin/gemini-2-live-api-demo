# Context Summary: js/tools/google-search.js

This file defines the `GoogleSearchTool` class, a stub implementation for a Google Search tool. Key features include:

- **Tool Declaration:** Provides a `getDeclaration()` method that returns the tool's name for registration with the ToolManager.
- **Execution Stub:** Implements an `execute()` method that currently does nothing and returns undefined.

This class serves as a placeholder for future integration of Google Search capabilities within the Gemini Live application.
