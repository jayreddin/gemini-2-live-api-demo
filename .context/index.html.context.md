# Context Summary: index.html

This file is the main HTML entry point for the Gemini Live application. It defines the application's UI layout, including:

- A container with buttons for disconnect, connect, settings, camera, screen, and microphone controls.
- A chat history display area.
- A canvas for audio visualization.
- Preview areas for camera and screen sharing.
- A text input field and send button for chat messages.

The file links to the main stylesheet (`css/styles.css`) and loads the main JavaScript module (`js/script.js`). All interactive elements are identified by unique IDs and classes for easy access by scripts and styles.

This file serves as the foundation for the application's frontend, with dynamic behavior handled by the linked JavaScript.
