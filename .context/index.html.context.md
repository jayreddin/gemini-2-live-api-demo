# Frontend Structure (index.html, css/styles.css)

## Purpose and Responsibilities
Defines the application's UI layout and visual style. Provides containers for chat, media previews, toolbars, and settings. CSS handles desktop-oriented layout, spacing, and component visibility.

## Key Elements and Roles
- **HTML**: Main containers for chat, media (camera/screen), toolbars, and settings.
- **CSS**: Desktop-first grid/flex layouts, fixed widths, hover/focus states, and font sizing.

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Relies on JavaScript for dynamic UI updates and event handling.
- CSS classes are tightly coupled to HTML structure and JS logic.

## Desktop-Specific Implementations
- Fixed or large minimum widths.
- Hover/focus effects for mouse interaction.
- Scrollbars and resizable panels.
- Toolbar and settings panels positioned for desktop screens.

## Areas Needing Mobile Adaptation
- Responsive layout (flex/grid to column, stacking, fluid widths).
- Touch-friendly controls (larger buttons, no hover).
- Adaptive font sizes and spacing.
- Hide/show panels for small screens.
- Mobile navigation patterns (drawers, bottom nav).

## Potential Challenges
- Ensuring all UI elements remain accessible and usable on small screens.
- Replacing hover/focus with touch equivalents.
- Managing dynamic resizing and orientation changes.
- Performance on lower-powered mobile devices.
