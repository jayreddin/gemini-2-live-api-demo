# Audio Processing System (AudioRecorder, AudioStreamer, AudioVisualizer)

## Purpose and Responsibilities
Handles audio capture, streaming, and visualization. Enables recording from the user's microphone, streaming audio data, and rendering audio waveforms or spectrograms.

## Key Functions and Roles
- **AudioRecorder**: Captures audio from the microphone, manages recording state, and emits audio data events.
- **AudioStreamer**: Streams audio data in real-time, manages audio buffers, and handles playback or transmission.
- **AudioVisualizer**: Visualizes audio input/output, draws waveforms or frequency data, and updates the UI in sync with audio.

## Dependencies and Relationships
- Uses Web Audio API and `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`.
- AudioRecorder and AudioStreamer may interact for live streaming scenarios.
- AudioVisualizer depends on audio data from recorder/streamer.

## Desktop-Specific Implementations
- Assumes stable microphone access and permissions.
- UI controls sized for mouse interaction.
- May use higher buffer sizes and less aggressive resource management.

## Areas Needing Mobile Adaptation
- Handle mobile microphone permission prompts and hardware variability.
- Optimize buffer sizes and processing for mobile CPUs.
- Touch-friendly controls for recording/streaming.
- Adapt visualization for smaller screens and lower refresh rates.

## Potential Challenges
- Microphone access restrictions and inconsistent hardware on mobile.
- Performance and battery impact of real-time audio processing.
- Ensuring smooth, low-latency streaming and visualization on mobile devices.
