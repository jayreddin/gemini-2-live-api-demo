# Context Summary: js/audio/streamer.js

This file defines the `AudioStreamer` class, responsible for real-time playback of streamed PCM audio data. Key features include:

- **Buffering and Scheduling:** Implements a sophisticated buffering system and look-ahead scheduler to ensure smooth, low-latency playback, even with network jitter.
- **Web Audio API Integration:** Uses AudioContext, GainNode, and BufferSource for precise audio playback and volume control.
- **Sample Rate Management:** Supports configurable sample rates and buffer sizes, adapting to application settings.
- **Playback Control:** Provides methods to start, stop, and initialize playback, including fade-out and cleanup of resources.
- **Error Handling:** Detects and recovers from buffer overflows, underruns, and invalid input.
- **Resource Management:** Tracks and cleans up all active audio sources and intervals to prevent leaks.

This class is essential for delivering high-quality, real-time audio output in the Gemini Live application.
