# Plan Phases and Steps
## Phase 1: Review and Planning
1. Review the full codebase files and learn the code structure.
2. Create a new folder called `APIDOCS` and store the provided API documentation in it.
3. Create a new folder called `plan` and summarize the files in it.

## Phase 2: Mobile Layout Implementation
1. Implement a complete mobile layout for the web app.
2. Use various modes to construct/implement the UI/UX for mobile.
3. Mobile layout and touch control requirements:
   - Request device permissions for camera, mic, and screen when activated.
   - Camera video preview is a floating, draggable, and resizable thumbnail; camera icon glows red when active, disables camera and preview when toggled off, and includes a flip camera button.

   - Settings popup includes new themes: light mode, sunset, multicolour.
   - Header includes a new Audio/Text switch to choose model reply mode.

## Phase 3: App Layout Restructure
1. Restructure the app layout according to the provided design.
2. Move the settings button to the top right corner.
3. Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile.

## Phase 4: Optimizations and New Features
1. Investigate and suggest app optimizations.
2. Investigate and suggest new features.

## Phase 5: Implementation and Testing
1. Implement the plan phase by phase.
2. Test and validate each phase.
